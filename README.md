# Recycling_Site
My final project for Networked-Media at NYU. 

Designed as a linear experience for users to explore the flawed system of recycling globally

The second half of the site 'scrollcopy.html' and 'infographic.html'was inspired by Beercamp SXSW 2011's site design. Those two files and what I used from Beercamp's site are all included in the 'Scroll' folder. 

Built with Node, Nedb, JS, Express, Ajax
